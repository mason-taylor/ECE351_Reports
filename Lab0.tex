\begin{enumerate}
    \item What did you do over the summer?\par
    Worked at Kaiser in Spokane, I got onto a large upgrade project that has been going on for a couple of years, so they kept me busy! Beyond that I did some hikes, picked huckleberries, and helped out my dad with some finish work on the new workshop.
    \item What do you personally want to get out of this lab?\par
    I am excited to do some simulation/modeling work in Python. I have done a fair amount of programming with Python CGI for making web pages, but have not done anything else with Python.
